Warning!
With 42.12 update for PZ TIS decided that: "Lets make something stupid! Let's remove scripts from game and merge into java code, lets leave modders in dark place where sun doesn't shine...". 
Editor is now not fully functional and will be no longer updated and supported. Thx TIS!


Editor for making scripts for modded clothing for Project Zomboid. For those who enjoyed - you can still making clothes if you had created previously with editor some scripts, they should be in database. Now you cannot edit or load any vanilla stuff.


Purpose of this tool is to automatic generate necessary scripts for modded clothing.


Executable files of working editor are in Compiled folder.
